# papers

Access online newspapers information.

## Installation

You can install the released version of papers from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("news-r/papers")
```

## Usage

You can either use `get_regions` and `get_papers` to get the latest data or you can use the `papers` dataset which should include all newspapers worldwide (at least the major ones).

## data

```{r data}
data("papers", package = "papers")
head(papers)
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(papers)

# get the list of regions available
regions <- get_regions()

# get papers from a specific region
(papers <- get_papers(regions, "Belgium"))
```
